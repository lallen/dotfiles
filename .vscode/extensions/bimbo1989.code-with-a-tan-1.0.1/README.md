## Improve me with Bracket Pair Colorizer!
### Very good with the [Bracket Pair Colorizer Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) with these settings
```
{
  "bracketPairColorizer.highlightActiveScope": true,
  "bracketPairColorizer.consecutivePairColors": [
    ["{", "}"],
    ["[", "]"],
    ["(", ")"],
    [
        "Black",
        "Green",
        "Blue",
        "Red"
    ],
    "Red"
  ]
}
```
